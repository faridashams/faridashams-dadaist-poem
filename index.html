    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.

      const article = `One of the many pieces of advice I got after her passing was that ‘it gets easier with time.’ It’s a phrase you hear all the time from all sorts of people who want to lend a comforting hand but don’t know how. But the night I found out my grandmother passed away, my aunt held my hand and led me outside away from the grieving eyes. I looked at her, sombre eyed, and she clutched me close to her chest, whispering ‘there will come a time where you’ll laugh when you hear her name instead of cry.’

I suppose she was right; it did get easier as the years went by. Still, what nobody tells you that with grief, the world goes on and you’re stuck in a loop, reliving the day they died. Nobody tells you how difficult it is to get used to your new normal. How in the first couple of months after her death, I would stumble on her name — my tongue faster than my brain — and ask about her whenever my grandfather came to visit. 

My grandparents were always a pair, to me they were Teta and Gedo, never just Gedo. 

Nobody tells you that even your dog could sense her absence. Sniffing around my grandfather’s legs to look for my grandmother, and whining when she is nowhere to be seen.

What will never get easier is the way my grandfather talks about her. He still wears his wedding band, twisting it whenever we bring her up in conversation.
